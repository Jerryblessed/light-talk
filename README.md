# Light Talk

**Light Talk** is a smart, AI-powered consultancy platform designed to revolutionize the way clients connect with expert consultants. By leveraging Twilio’s robust messaging and calling APIs along with cutting-edge AI, Light Talk enables seamless communication via SMS, voice calls, and WhatsApp. The platform even features an interactive live avatar that simulates the expert's persona for a more engaging and personalized experience.

## Inspiration

In today’s fast-paced world, getting timely access to expert advice is more critical than ever. Traditional communication methods like emails and scheduled calls often result in delays and missed opportunities. Research indicates that businesses utilizing mobile messaging (e.g., SMS) experience up to a **45% faster response time** compared to email ([SAS Insights](https://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/articles/marketing/text-message-marketing.html)). Inspired by this, we set out to create a platform that makes expert consultancy both fast and accessible—regardless of physical location.
